# Run The Numbers
{: .no_toc }

Based on BashCo's [RunTheNumbers](https://github.com/BashCo/RunTheNumbers) script.

Run The Numbers is part of a synchronized decentralized audit of the Bitcoin supply.  A target block height is agreed upon whereby many participants will simultaneously run a similar script on their node.  This version is setup to automatically run as a service, and by default, run the numbers every 5000 blocks, or about once every 34 to 35 days based on a target of 10 minute block times.  Results are saved in the /home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers folder. Instructions for reviewing the results are also outlined below.

## Simplified Script

* As user "admin", create the runthenumbers script by copy/paste the following. Save and exit.
```sh
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/runthenumbers
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Every N Blocks, we run the numbers
NBLOCK=5000

last_run_block=-1
while true
do
    # Get the current block height
    current_block=$(bitcoin-cli getblockcount)
    current_block=$(expr $current_block + 1 - 1)
    # Determine if it matches our N blocks condition
    mod_block=$(expr $current_block % $NBLOCK)
    if [[ $mod_block -eq "0" ]]; then
        # Make sure we didnt just run the numbers of the same block
        if [[ $current_block -gt $last_run_block ]]; then
            # Run the numbers and store the output!
            last_run_block=$current_block
            txoutsetinfo=$(bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo)
            echo "${txoutsetinfo}" > "/home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers/the_numbers_${current_block}.txt"
            echo "${txoutsetinfo}" > "/home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers/the_numbers_latest.txt"
        fi
    fi
    # Wait a few seconds before checking again
    sleep 5
done
```

* Make it executable
```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/run/runthenumbers
```

* Create a data directory on the external drive and link it to the "bitcoin" user home.

```sh
sudo su - bitcoin
mkdir /mnt/ext/runthenumbers
ln -s /mnt/ext/runthenumbers /home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers
```


## Autostart on boot

We want this script to start automatically on system boot.

* As user "admin", create the runthenumbers systemd unit and copy/paste the following configuration. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/runthenumbers.service
  ```

  ```ini
  # RaspiBolt: systemd unit for runthenumbers
  # /etc/systemd/system/runthenumbers.service

  [Unit]
  Description=Run The Numbers Daemon
  Wants=bitcoind.service
  After=bitcoind.service

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

* Enable and start RunTheNumbers.

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl enable runthenumbers
  $ sudo systemctl start runthenumbers
  ```

* Check the systemd journal to see runthenumbers' log output.
  Exit with `Ctrl`-`C`.

  ```sh
  $ sudo journalctl -f -u runthenumbers
  ```
## Display Results

The latest results from running the numbers can be displayed as follows

```sh
cat /home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers/the_numbers_latest.txt
```

If you just want the total supply as of the last time the numbers were ran

```sh
cat /home/bitcoin/.runthenumbers/the_numbers_latest.txt | jq '.total_amount'
```
